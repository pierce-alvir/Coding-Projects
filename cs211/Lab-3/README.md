## Lab 3: Working with Binary in C

*Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols.*

### SUMMARY

The header file includes libraries for the code, defines the constant ARRAY_SIZE, and declares the functions for the code. The lab3binary file has two functions. The first function finds the left most position of a binary version of a decimal number, and the second function returns an array of the binary version of a decimal number in either right order or reverse order depending on if the decimal number is even or odd.
