## Lab-6: String Manipulations

*Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols.*

### SUMMARY

The first function changes the cases of any letters in the string and counts it, returning the count. If the string is empty, it returns 0. The second function returns 0 and an unmodified string if there are any non-letters in the string or the string is empty. If the string is all letters, it reverses the order of the string and returns 1.
