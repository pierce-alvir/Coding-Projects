## Lab-7: Working with Structures

*Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols.*

### SUMMARY

Using the structure Date that includes unsigned integers for year, month, and day, two functions were made to calculate the time in days between both dates and the day of the week that the date falls on. The two functions were made using 4 other functions that check if each date is valid, calculate years and month values based on if the month is January or February, and a function that calculates N based off of the years and months calculated from the previous functions.
